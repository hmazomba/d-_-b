      "* **Abundant in the universe:** They are produced in vast quantities by nuclear reactions, such as those happening in the sun. \n",
      "* **Rarely interact with matter:** They can pass through most matter without leaving a trace, making them difficult to detect.\n",

G. Leopold, the epic poem Odin eller Danrigets Stiftelse (1803) by Jens Baggesen, the poem Maskeradenball (1803) and Optrin af Norners og Asers Kamp: He notes that \\\"similar depictions occur everywhere the Vikings went—from eastern England to Russia and naturally also in the rest of Scandinavia.\\\"[77]\\nA portion of Thorwald's Cross (a partly surviving runestone erected at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man) depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf, his right foot in its mouth, and a large bird on his shoulder.[78] Andy Orchard comments that this bird may be either Huginn or Muninn.[79] Rundata dates the cross to 940,[80] while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century.[78] This depiction has been interpreted as Odin, with a raven or eagle at his shoulder, being consumed by the monstrous wolf Fenrir during the events of Ragnarök.[78][81]\\nThe 11th century Ledberg stone in Sweden, similarly to Thorwald's Cross, features a figure with his foot at the mouth of a four-legged beast, and this may also be a depiction of Odin being devoured by Fenrir at Ragnarök.[81] Regarding the Germanic peoples, Caesar states: \\\"[T]hey consider the gods only the ones that they can see, the Sun, Fire and the Moon\\\", which scholars reject as clearly mistaken, regardless of what may have led to the statement.[24]\\nThere is no direct, undisputed evidence for the worship of Odin/Mercury among the Goths, and the existence of a cult of Odin among them is debated.[26] Richard North and Herwig Wolfram have both argued that the Goths did not worship Odin, Wolfram contending that the use of Greek names of the week in Gothic provides evidence of that.[27] The völva says that the two were capable of very little, lacking in ørlög and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods:\\nThe meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary.[46]\\nLater in the poem, the völva recounts the events of the Æsir–Vanir War, the war between Vanir and the Æsir, two groups of gods. This was influenced by an embellished list of rulers invented by Johannes Magnus.[88]\\nUnder the trifunctional hypothesis of Georges Dumézil, Odin is assigned one of the core functions in the Indo-European pantheon as a representative of the first function (sovereignty) corresponding to the Hindu Varuṇa (fury and magic) as opposed to Týr, who corresponds to the Hindu Mitrá (law and justice); while the Vanir represent the third function (fertility).[89][90]\\nAnother approach to Odin has been in terms of his function and attributes.\"}]\n",
